Javascript, Webpack, Node, React, honestly the browser APIS get their own mention, Java, Spring. You could argue Bash & powershell.

Not opposed to learning whatever. As you can see have been spending most of my time doing JS based webdev + Java for the backend. Recently trying out some C++ and WASM. C# looks pretty awesome.
